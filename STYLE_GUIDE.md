## Adjectives & Usage

| Adjective | The Luxury "Vibe" | Best Used For... |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Pristine** | Untouched, laboratory-clean purity. | Cleansers and base oils. |
| **Luminous** | The high-end "glow" of health. | Serums and brightening creams. |
| **Ancestral** | Hints at timeless heritage and wisdom. | Traditional botanical extracts. |
| **Velvet** | Premium sensory texture. | Night creams and rich balms. |
| **Sovereign** | Authority, power, and high-tier status. | Anti-aging or "Hero" products. |
| **Gilded** | Connects directly to your Gold accents. | High-value oils or gold-infused items. |
| **Transcendent** | Beyond basic skincare; an experience. | Masks and spa-quality rituals. |
| **Potent** | Scientific efficacy without chemicals. | Active organic concentrates. |
| **Distilled** | Refined, concentrated, and essential. | Toners and floral waters. |

## How to use these in your Style Guide

To maintain "Quiet Luxury" for Asper Beauty Shop, never use more than **two** of these adjectives in a single sentence.

*   **Incorrect (Too "Salesy"):** "Our opulent, luminous, gilded oil is transcendent!"
*   **The Asper Way:** "A distilled infusion of organic rose, designed to leave a luminous finish."

## The Luxury Copy Equation

For your 2,000 products, apply this logic to every description:

$$ \text{Descriptive Adjective} + \text{Scientific Function} = \text{Boutique Elegance} $$

## Final "Save & Checkout" Audit

Before finalizing the project:

1.  **The "Jordan Standard":** Double-check that all weights are in grams (g) or milliliters (ml) as per Jordanian pharmacy standards.
2.  **The Cream Consistency:** Ensure no product images have a "pure white" background—they should all be softened to your Pearl Cream to prevent screen glare.
3.  **The Hover Logic:** Ensure the "Ingredient Reveal" hover effect is active for the "Organic" category specifically; it builds immense trust.
